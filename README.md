# KEMSYZ-Internship
This repository serves as a structured record of my work and learning throughout my internship period, which commenced on 15 January 2026 and is scheduled to continue until 15 March 2026. It includes ongoing tasks, experiments, and deliverables that reflect my practical contributions, technical growth, and evolving understanding of real-world systems. As the internship is currently in progress, this repository will be continuously updated to document new developments, improvements, and insights gained along the way.
