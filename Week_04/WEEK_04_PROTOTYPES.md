# Week 4 — Prototype Screens (Pre-Development Phase)

> ⚠️ **Note:** The following screens are early-stage prototypes created during the ideation and planning phase.  
> These are conceptual UI explorations and do not represent the final application design.

## Overview

During Week 4 of my internship at CODELOUNGE Pvt. Ltd., I focused on ideation and pre-development planning for the **E-Learn** project.  
These prototypes were created to visualize user flows, validate ideas, and explore potential UI structures before starting full development.

They helped in:
- Understanding user navigation
- Planning feature hierarchy
- Visualizing educator and student workflows
- Structuring the app architecture

## Purpose of These Prototypes

These early visuals played an important role in:
- Refining the project direction
- Planning modular development
- Defining dual-portal architecture (Educator + Student)
- Reducing redesign effort during implementation

---

## Transition to Development

Following these prototypes:
- Week 5 focused on **Educator Portal development**
- Week 6 focused on **Student Portal development**

This progression reflects a structured design-to-development workflow followed during the internship.
